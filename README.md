# 30 Days of JavaScript

Welcome to my **30 Days of JavaScript** challenge! 🚀  

I’m a beginner on a mission to conquer JavaScript one project at a time—and I’m not one to back down. These mini-projects are my sandbox for experimenting, learning, and sharing the thrill of building something real. Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve got some lines of code under your belt, join me on this journey—let’s push boundaries, spark curiosity, and celebrate every “aha!” moment along the way.
